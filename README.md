# Sum-Letter-Place-Values
Simple python program to calculate the sum of the alphabetical order of every letter in a string (a = 1, b = 2, z = 26, etc...).

It ignores invalid characters other than new line characters, make sure you remove any of them prior.

Tested on Ubuntu Linux 20.04 using python 3.8, there are some subprocess commands which may not work in Windows. Just comment them out and make sure your string is short enough for your terminal to support it.

To run it:

python3 sumLetterPlaceValues.py
